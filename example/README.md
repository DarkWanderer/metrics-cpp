# Example Program

The `example.cpp` file provides a simple example of how this library can be used in an application to invoke the basic metrics types. 

This application can be compiled and ran simply through invoking the `build.sh` script. When the program executes it will create a file `example.json` in the current directory with the sample metrics exported as JSON.

> Note: The `metrics-cpp-json` library must first be compiled to the `build` directory before the sample program can be exected. See the [Build README](https://github.com/KyleLavorato/metrics-cpp-json#building) for instructions.
